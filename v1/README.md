Version 0 + dimensionality reduction

The geometry is described by CNPI group symmetry adapted and scaled internal coordinate

The internal coordinates are compressed by dimensionality reduction networks

The input layer of each Hd element is the CNPI group symmetry adapted polynomial of the reduced coordinates

When the Hd network has no hidden layer, i.e. output layer directly follows input layer, it is equivalent to a polynomial
