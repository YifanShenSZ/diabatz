The most basic version

The geometry is described by CNPI group symmetry adapted and scaled internal coordinate

The input layer of each Hd element is the CNPI group symmetry adapted polynomial of the geometry

When the network has no hidden layer, i.e. output layer directly follows input layer, it is equivalent to a polynomial
