# CNPI2point
A small tool to help to map the global CNPI group to the local point group of a certain data point

`CNPI2point.exe` reads geometries then tell user which CNPI group irreducibles have nonzero internal coordinate

Unfortunately, the user has to manually tag data points with their point group and map CNPI group irreducibles to point group irreducibles
