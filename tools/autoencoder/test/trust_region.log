The data set will be read from: 
    min-Cs/, 
There are 76 data points

The data set corresponds to 2052 least sqaure equations
There are 962 parameters to train

The number of threads = 4
Each thread owns 19 data points
Thread 0 starts with Jacobian row 0
Thread 1 starts with Jacobian row 513
Thread 2 starts with Jacobian row 1026
Thread 3 starts with Jacobian row 1539

The initial RMSD = 0.924462
 Failed trust region: max iteration exceeded!
 Final residual =   6.435639510571022E-002
The final RMSD = 0.00738218
